# LexicalDistance
This script generates a network map of lexemes, conceived as nodes linked to one another according to their similarity. For best results, it is advisable to restrict the domain to homogenous semantic classes, such as for instance personal names. Input file must contain the list of lexemes to be analysed, one lexeme per line.
